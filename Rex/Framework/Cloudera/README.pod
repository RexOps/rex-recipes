=head2 Cloudera Hadoop Framework

This is my first draft of the Rex-Module for Cloudera Hadoop Framework.

This Rex-Module is at the moment under heavy development.

=head2 What works at the moment?

You can install a Hadoop-Cluster on a single host and configure
this pseudo cluster with default values.

=head2 What next?

The next steps are:

* Configuring a multi-host cluster
* Include more Cloudera components (Hive, Pig, and so on)

=head2 Future ideas

* Rex HDFS Module (manipulate directly HDFS through Rex)
