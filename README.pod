=head2 DEPRECATED

This repository is considered as a deprecated approach to collect and distribute Rex modules, and will be archived.

The main problems are:

=over 4

=item Doesn't scale

A few people must maintain all the modules, including testing and reviews, even if they are not the authors. That proved to be an unrealistic expectation.

=item Disconnects authors from their code

Once a module is merged, the author loses direct maintainership of it, since they can only interact with it via pull requests. They could be granted access to directly manage this repo, therefore all modules, but that is probably not what anyone wants.

=back

=head2 What now?

Since Rex code is just Perl code, Rex modules are best maintained and distributed in the standard Perl ways. You are encouraged to have your own repos for your own modules, ask L<PrePAN|http://prepan.org> for feedback, and perhaps also use L<PAUSE|https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about> to publish to L<CPAN|https://www.cpan.org>.

=head1 ARCHIVE 

Everything below is considered outdated, but kept available for your reference.

=head2 WHAT'S THIS?

This is a community repository for Rex Recipes.

Everyone is invited to fork this repository and do pull requests.

=head2 USAGE

As of Rex Version 0.25 there will be a command for I<rexify> to search and download recipes for own Rex projects.

 rexify --search=mysql
 rexify <projectname> [directory] --use=Rex::Database::MySQL
 rexify <projectname> [directory] --use=Rex::Database::MySQL --use=Rex::Webserver::Apache ...


=head2 HOWTO CONTRIBUTE

=over 4

=item *

Choose a category. 

For example if you are developing a recipe for a Webserver like Apache, nginx, ... use the I<Webserver> category. If you are developing a recipe for Usermanagement use the Category I<User>. 

You can create new categories if there is no category that suite your needs.

If you don't know which category to use, just use the "Misc" category.

=item *

I don't want to dictate style guides. Just have fun.

For reference, i use space indention with 2 spaces.
