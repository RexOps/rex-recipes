=head2 HOWTO CONTRIBUTE

=over 4

=item *

Choose a category. 

For example if you are developing a recipe for a Webserver like Apache, nginx, ... use the I<Webserver> category. If you are developing a recipe for Usermanagement use the Category I<User>. 

You can create new categories if there is no category that suite your needs.

If you don't know which category to use, just use the "Misc" category.

=item *

I don't want to dictate style guides. Just have fun.

For reference, i use space indention with 3 spaces.
